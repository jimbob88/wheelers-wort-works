# Wheeler's Wort Works
A rebuild of Wheeler's Beer Engine written in Python with continuous updates

## Windows
### Using a release build (64-bit only)

First head to the [release page](https://github.com/jimbob88/wheelers-wort-works/releases "Release Files"), and download the latest `exe.win-amd64-3.6.zip`.
Unzip the file with File Explorer and you should have a new folder named `exe.win-amd64-3.6`, on opening this folder you may see another folder named exe.win-amd64-3.6 if so simply open this and continue.

Now simply Double-Click the `main.exe` file - if this fails try opening it again once more. If this fails again post an issue at the [issues page](https://github.com/jimbob88/wheelers-wort-works/issues) or move onto the next area.

### Running from source (32-bit or 64-bit)

Download the latest addition of Wheeler's Wort Works [here](https://github.com/jimbob88/wheelers-wort-works/archive/master.zip "Latest ZIP File"), then unzip
the `wheelers-wort-works-master.zip` file with File Explorer and you should have a new folder named `wheelers-wort-works-master`, on opening this folder you may see another folder named wheelers-wort-works-master if so simply open this and continue.

If Python isn't installed follow [this handy guide](https://realpython.com/installing-python/ "Real Python Guide to installing Python3") then continue to the next step.

After you have python installed either Double-Click the `main.py` file found in `wheelers-wort-works-master`, if this fails Right-Click and edit with Idle, then press `F5`, you should be greeted by the Beer Engine Screen.

## Linux
### Ubuntu or Debian
If you're running Ubuntu (or an Ubuntu Variant i.e. Xubuntu, Lubuntu, Kubuntu) or Debian it is recommended to install the  latest _.deb_ file.  Then open a terminal (typically with `Ctrl+Alt+T`).

Download the file, navigate to your download folder typically `~/Downloads/` by running the command `cd ~/Downloads`. Then run the command `sudo apt-get install ./wheelers-wort-works_2.1a_all.deb`.
If this command fails, attempt to install the file with:
```
sudo dpkg -i wheelers-wort-works_2.1a_all.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Linux x86_64 4.15.0-46+ (Check Linux version with uname -r)
